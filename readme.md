# Quickstart for Angular 2 with Webpach and Less

> This is a quickstart project for [Angular 2][angular2]. It use the
> [Webpack][webpack] and the css processor [Less][less].

## Why this quickstart?

I come from Angular 1 and building application with [Gulp][gulp]. It is very confused to start with Angular 2. On one hand the tutorials tell with [Systemjs][Systemjs] and from other hand it use [Webpack][webpack].

So, I begin with Webpack and choice Less, because it seems pretty easyier.

## Requirements

* Node 6 or higher
* Angular 2.3 or higher
* Webpack 2.x or higher
* Less

I use the exact version of the dependencies in the file `package.json`, because it is easier to find errors.
